A [command][cmd] is a way of saying “Hey Elm, I need\nyou to perform all these tasks.” This lets us update our model *and* make HTTP\nrequests or whatever else.\n\nSecond we add a `subscriptions` function. Similar to `view` it is always\napplied to the latest model, but instead of HTML it gives us a list of\n*subscriptions*. A [subscription][sub] is a way of saying “Hey Elm, I need\nyou to listen for any updates about these various things.” Now when you get\na geolocation change or a websocket message, it will be given to your update\nfunction.\n\n[cmd]: http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Platform-Cmd\n[sub]: http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Platform-Sub\n\nNow again, it is very important that you read [the Elm Architecture Tutorial][tutorial]\nbecause it describes how these building blocks work and how you can put them\ntogether into a nice modular architecture.
