Thanks

This package is an effort to consolidate [lorenzo/elm-string-addons](https://github.com/lorenzo/elm-string-addons),
[NoRedInk/elm-string-extra](https://github.com/NoRedInk/elm-string-extra), and
add utility functions inspired by [underscore.string](http://epeli.github.io/underscore.string/).

So thanks to the authors of those libraries for making `string-extra` possible.
